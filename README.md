# Built following the [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

Recommend adding [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi/related?hl=en) to Chrome

```js
React.Component
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
    }
    props
    render
    setState
    state
```

## Notes

React communicates between components similar to Angulars Input() and Output() emitters.  If even switching from Angular to React, it may first be a good idea to change service communication to emitters.
